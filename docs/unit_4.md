## Task 5.2.: Convert an ARM template to Bicep

## Task 5.4: Using modules from a registry

We won't be deploying from a registry today, but feel free to read about how that works in practice: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/share-bicep-modules-using-private-registries/6-use-module-from-registry

# Clean-up

- When you're done, you can delete the resource group that you used for deploying resources. That removes not only the rg but also any resources.
- Switch subscription back?



# To be checked
- What's this: The configuration value of bicep.use_binary_from_path has been set to 'false'.
- Anatomy of template/module, slide vs article. Symbolic names vs Azure names, etc.
