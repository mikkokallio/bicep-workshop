# Preparations

## Task 0.1: Check readiness in Cloud Shell

## Task 0.2: Create resource group

If working in a shared subscription, it's important that each participant has a resource group with a unique name.

Note: Normally, it's a good practice to group together resources in resource groups according to their lifecycles: "Resources that live together and die together." However, to keep things simple, we're using a single resource group for all resources. ()

# Unit 1: Create, modify, and destroy resources

## Task 1.1: Create network

## Task 1.2: Modify
