# Bicep workshop

This is a 1-day workshop to illustrate the fundamental concepts and syntax of Bicep, and to learn how deploy resources with Bicep templates on the command-line.

## Target architecture

The above picture shows most of the resources used in the hands-on exercises. Additionally, a storage account is deployed.

## Model solution

See [this folder](https://github.com/mikkokallio/bicep-workshop/blob/main/code/) for a model solution that was created during the workshop in the hands-on session. Some tasks were skipped, so it doesn't have all features.

## After the workshop

When you're done, you can delete the resource group that you used for deploying resources. That removes not only the rg but also any resources.
